Is it just me, or is the phrase 'killing intent roiled off' new to this series? As in, wasn't used in ISSTH, Renegade Immortal etc.
'(...)it was very different from how he had imagined Immortals would look when they fought.' And how did he imagine them fight then? A bit of fencing while they swirl their thin mustaches with free hand, followed by apologizing for giving the other party a nick with a perfect british accent before offering their hated enemy a round of tea and biscuits, wiping the sweat from their eyebrows with the towel a servant brought them? Sorry to disappoint Xiaochun, but you missed the country. Downton Abbey is all the way in Great Britain.
